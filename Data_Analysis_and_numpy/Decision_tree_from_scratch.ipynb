    "# Structure of Decision Tree\n",
    "A Decision Tree has a tree-like structure with each internal node denoting a test on an attribute, each branch representing an outcome of the test, and each terminal node (leaf) holding a class label. Here are the parts of a Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Root Node: This houses the entire dataset.\n",
    "- Internal Nodes: These make decisions based on conditions.\n",
    "- Edges/branches: These connections implement decision rules.\n",
    "- Leaves: These are terminal nodes for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions on attributes depend on how well they help to purify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree-building process begins with the full dataset at the root node, iteratively partitioning the data based on chosen attributes. Each child node becomes a new root that can be split further. This recursive process continues until predefined stopping criteria are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopping Criteria for Tree Building\n",
    "Standard stopping criteria include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum Tree Depth: Limiting the maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    "- Minimum Node Records: No more partitioning if less than a threshold number of records.\n",
    "- Node Purity: Stop if all instances at a node belong to the same class.\n",
    "These criteria ensure the model is consistent, which prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n"

    "## Implementing a Decision Tree using GINI\n",
    "A Decision Tree is a tree-like graph that models decisions and their potential consequences. It starts at a single node, called the root, which splits into branches. Each branch, in turn, splits into more branches, forming a hierarchical network. The final branches with no further splits are referred to as leaf nodes. Each split is determined by whether the data satisfies a specific condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we build a Decision Tree to predict whether a patient will recover from a disease, the root could be temperature> 101F. The tree would then split into two branches - one for yes and another for no. Each branch could further split based on another attribute, such as cough present. This process of splitting continues until we conclude the leaf nodes, such as recovery probable or recovery doubtful"
